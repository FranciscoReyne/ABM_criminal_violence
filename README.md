# ABM Criminal Violence  
Agent-Based Model for environments where multiple criminal actors compete for territory.

**Q: When multiple criminal actors compete for territory, what do they depend on, and how do violence levels behave?**

## ABM  

An agent-based model could be a valuable tool for simulating and analyzing the dynamics of criminal organizations within a given market. These models work by creating autonomous agents with behavioral rules that reflect the logic of the environment in which they operate. In this context, they could help in the following aspects:

1. **Simulation of criminal structures**: Different sizes of organizations—large, medium, and small—can be modeled with rules on how they operate, interact, and compete for resources within the illicit market.

2. **Evaluation of stability and resilience**: Analyzing which type of organization is more stable against external pressures, such as government actions, competition among groups, or changes in market demand.

3. **Analysis of evolution and fragmentation**: Observing whether organizations tend to split into smaller cells due to risks associated with centralization or if maintaining large structures with economies of scale in illicit activities is more beneficial.

4. **Intervention strategies**: Enabling authorities to model how certain policies (leadership disruption, market control, incentives for individual actors) affect the structure and stability of organized crime.

5. **Optimization of law enforcement resources**: Identifying which criminal structures may be more vulnerable or prone to collapse under specific interventions and assessing the impact of various dismantling strategies.

These models can provide key insights into how criminal organizations evolve within their environment and help design more effective policies for their control.

## ABM Part 2: Hypothesis that violence increases when more actors compete for territory.  

This hypothesis makes a lot of sense from the perspective of illegal market dynamics and group rivalry. In environments where multiple criminal actors compete for territory, violence levels tend to rise as each group seeks to establish its dominance and prevent others from taking their position. Aggression can become particularly intense when there are no clear power structures or when a large group fragments, generating both internal and external conflicts.

An agent-based model could help analyze this hypothesis by simulating different scenarios, such as:  
- **Markets dominated by a single large organization**: Violence might be lower if one actor has control and establishes internal behavioral rules, reducing open conflicts.  
- **Competition among several small and medium-sized groups**: Aggression could increase if groups constantly attempt to expand and protect their territory.  
- **Impact of external strategies (such as police intervention or containment policies)**: If intervention dismantles large structures without a plan to manage fragmentation, the number of actors and resulting violence could increase.  

The challenge is finding intervention strategies that minimize harm to people uninvolved in the conflict. Some possible strategies include:  
- **Selective dismantling**: Focusing efforts on groups that generate more violence rather than applying uniform measures.  
- **Incentives to reduce territorial conflicts**: Encouraging dynamics that prevent prolonged disputes over territorial control.  
- **Monitoring and prediction**: Using data to anticipate moments of heightened violence risk and act preventively.  

### Selective Dismantling  

Selective dismantling focuses on strategically weakening criminal structures with minimal impact on overall violence and uninvolved populations. Instead of applying uniform measures, the goal is to identify and target the most vulnerable or dangerous points within a criminal organization. Here are some key approaches:  

#### 1. **Identification of key actors**  
   - Agent-based models can help detect leaders, financiers, and coordinators within the organization.  
   - Selectively eliminating these actors can create internal destabilization, forcing groups to restructure and reducing their operational efficiency.  

#### 2. **Network analysis and breaking points**  
   - Using communication, transaction, and movement data to identify critical connections.  
   - Instead of eliminating an entire group, targeting the most important links can fragment its structure without fostering the creation of multiple violent cells.  

#### 3. **Demobilization and member conversion**  
   - Offering alternatives to key members (e.g., informants, defectors) can weaken the organization without triggering territorial wars.  
   - Reintegration programs can prevent displaced members from joining other criminal structures.  

#### 4. **Control of resources and financing**  
   - Limiting access to money, weapons, and support networks can hinder the expansion capabilities of certain groups.  
   - This can be achieved through stricter regulations in areas like money laundering, goods trafficking, and illicit markets.  

#### 5. **Intervention tailored to the type of organization**  
   - Large groups can be dismantled by targeting their hierarchy and financial management.  
   - Small groups can be neutralized with prevention and conversion strategies, avoiding their multiplication after a major organization's collapse.  

The success of selective dismantling depends on deep context analysis and careful planning to avoid unintended consequences, such as increased violence due to fragmentation.  

### Monitoring and Prediction  

**Monitoring and prediction** are essential for anticipating criminal organization behavior and reducing violence against uninvolved individuals. Key aspects include:  

#### 1. **Real-time data collection**  
   - Use of **sensors, cameras, intercepted communications, and financial analysis** to detect patterns in criminal activities.  
   - Intelligence from social media and interaction analysis to identify suspicious movements.  

#### 2. **Agent-based predictive models**  
   - Simulation of criminal scenarios to forecast crisis points and territorial conflicts.  
   - Analysis of historical data to identify factors preceding an increase in violence.  

#### 3. **Identification of high-risk zones**  
   - Mapping territories with higher criminal activity and predicting possible expansions or confrontations.  
   - Evaluating criminal actors’ dynamics and strategy shifts.  

#### 4. **Early warning and rapid response**  
   - Pattern detection algorithms for violent events that can generate early intervention alerts.  
   - Coordination of security forces with real-time intelligence to prevent escalations.  

#### 5. **Impact assessment of interventions**  
   - Measuring the effects of dismantling strategies and adjusting policies in real time.  
   - Identifying signs of criminal fragmentation to prevent increased violence.  

The goal is to **minimize population impact and reduce aggression among actors**, using technology to anticipate and manage crises before they unfold.  

### Incentives to Reduce Territorial Conflicts  

Reducing territorial conflicts among criminal organizations through **strategic incentives** could help decrease violence affecting uninvolved populations. Some key approaches include:  

#### 1. **Informally regulated markets**  
   - In some contexts, criminal groups have adopted internal regulation systems to avoid unnecessary disputes.  
   - Creation of “neutral zones” or informal agreements between groups to minimize territorial confrontations.  

#### 2. **Incentives for cooperation**  
   - Instead of violent competition, incentives could be promoted for illicit market-sharing agreements.  
   - Examples include non-aggression pacts or exchange networks that prevent conflicts over scarce resources.  

#### 3. **Reducing the profitability of disputed territories**  
   - Implementing measures to make territorial control less attractive.  
   - This could be achieved through strategic police presence, economic barriers, or social programs that hinder criminal activity.  

#### 4. **Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms**  
   - Establishing informal mediation mechanisms between criminal groups to prevent conflicts from escalating into direct violence.  
   - In some countries, mediators have intervened between organizations to prevent prolonged wars.  

#### 5. **Transforming illicit market dynamics**  
   - Changing the operational model of illegal markets to reduce territorial competition.  
   - An example is the digital trade of illicit goods, which reduces the need for physical control over strategic points.  

These strategies can minimize unnecessary conflicts and reduce civilians’ exposure to violence stemming from criminal rivalries.
